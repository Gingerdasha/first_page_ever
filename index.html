        The <span class="breed">Siberian Husky</span> is a medium-sized working
        sled dog breed. The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family. It is
        recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears,
        and distinctive markings, and is smaller than the similar-looking
        <span class="breed">Alaskan Malamute</span>.
        <span class="breed">Siberian Huskies</span> originated in Northeast Asia
        where they are bred by the Chukchi people of Siberia for sled pulling,
        and companionship. It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose
        ancestors lived in the extremely cold and harsh environment of the
        Siberian Arctic.
